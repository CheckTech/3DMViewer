3DMViewer
=========

A Viewer for Rhino OpenNURBS 3DM files based on OpenSceneGraph.

The openNURBS Initiative provides CAD, CAM, CAE, and computer
graphics software developers the tools to accurately transfer
3-D geometry between applications.

The OpenSceneGraph is an open source high performance 3D graphics 
toolkit, used by application developers in fields such as visual 
simulation, games, virtual reality, scientific visualization and 
modelling. Written entirely in Standard C++ and OpenGL it runs on 
all Windows platforms, OSX, GNU/Linux, IRIX, Solaris, HP-Ux, AIX 
and FreeBSD operating systems. The OpenSceneGraph is now well 
established as the world leading scene graph technology, used widely 
in the vis-sim, space, scientific, oil-gas, games and virtual reality 
industries.
